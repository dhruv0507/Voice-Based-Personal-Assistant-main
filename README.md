# Voice Based Personal Assistant

We have built a Voice based Personal Assistant for people to access files hands free in their device using natural language processing.

The features of the assistant are that it can open folders on the voice commands of the user, open files in that folder and also find words in that file and create new file containing pages that had the word user was looking for in the file.We have made this project on python using NLP and libraries like speech_recognition, os, datetime, ELmo, tensorflow, spacy, PyPDF2, sklearn, pandas, regex, PyQT5.
